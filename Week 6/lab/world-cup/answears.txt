Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
The more productions that where run the further the acutal winner of the tournamet for the mens
France got pushed down the changes, I beleave that as more an more games get played it is more likely
that the higher rated teams would win more often there for their percentage of winning increasing

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
Obvousily i would want to keep the compute time to as small time as possible, as the more time that
this program is ran the extra time of the larger simulations would start to compound.
