If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
The average energy is 0.65906, valence is 0.484443, danceability is 0.71646. Form this we can characterise the audio aura of this persons music being someone who most of the time likes to listen to songs
that make you want to dance and have high energy but the tracks have a slight leen to the more negative side over the posative.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
This is not the best way to calcualte this persons aura due to the fact that any extream outlire sould easly say the average one way or the other. One better way of calculating a persons aura would be
to include the number of times that a person played a song, this means that songs that are played more regulary can have a higher waighting to them than songs that are not played that often.
